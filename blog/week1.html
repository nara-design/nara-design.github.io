                    <h1>research</h1>
                    <p>To understand the context surrounding the problem, I did some research in the form of reading articles and interviewing people in the relevant demographic.</p>
                </section>
                <!-- blurb finish -->

                <!-- articles start -->
                <section>
                    <h2>articles</h2>
                    <p>I started off with some surface-level research from the following sources:</p>
                    <p>
                        1. <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/our-research/how-young-people-consume-news-and-implications-mainstream-media">How Young People Consume News and the Implications for Mainstream Media</a>
                        <br>
                        2. <a href="https://www.inma.org/blogs/media-leaders/post.cfm/gen-z-readers-need-news-media-to-know-these-3-things">Gen Z readers need news media to know these 3 things</a>
                        <br>
                        3. <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/profile/lineup-systems/news/gen-z-and-the-news-how-to-keep-young-people-interested">Gen Z and the news: how to keep young people interested</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>From which I made note of such things as how traditional news media isn't necessarily seen (by youth) as the best way to stay updated on news; Gen Z news consumers don't tend to let news come them rather than seek it; Gen Z make up more than 40% of global consumers; Gen Z are very sceptical of news in general; and they value brand authenticity over brand loyalty.</p>
                    <p>I then moved onto some deeper reading from these sources:</p>

                    <p>The main points of interest I drew from this research are as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>young people are highly reliant on their phones and often access news via phone</li>
                            <li>the majority (58%) of Gen Z still prefer text over video because of the control and flexibility (video is just one way that can engage younger audiences, but not necessarily the best way)</li>
                            <li>younger audiences do not want to work hard for their news (passive consumption is preferred)</li>
                            <li>authenticity to valued by younger audiences</li>
                            <li>it's unlikely for younger users to access news from one source alone or abandon platforms they're already used to using</li>
                            <li>people in general are more likely to keep up with (and care about) local news</li>
                            <li>young audiences like content/info that is curated for them</li>
                            <li>young audiences tend to avoid news because it leaves them in a bad mood</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, younger audiences may like certain media networks because they are:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>informal</li>

                    <p>I interviewed a few people from Gen Z to get an idea of their attitudes towards news. The simplified findings are presented below.</p>
                    <p><b>Nami (Age 18)</b></p>

                            <li>likes them for the bite-sized content and visual appeal</li>
                            <li>doesn't look at any dedicated news sites/apps/services</li>
                            <li>tends to click out of any news story that takes a long time to read/doesn't keep her interest</li>

                            <li>generally informed on current events both internationally and nationally</li>
                            <li>goes on a doom-scroll usually once a day</li>
                            <li>likes using Reddit (app) because a wholesome popup appears when the phone gets shaken (nice break from the doom-scroll)</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>associates news with 6pm news on the TV</li>
                            <li>doesn't find it convenient to keep up with news</li>
                            <li>mainly gets news from TikTok (passively, not intentionally finding it)</li>
                            <li>also gets news from other people in real life</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Based on the research findings and whilst referring to the personas, I created a list of brain-dump ideas:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>be visually engaging:</b> good ux design, mix of ways to consume news that aren't just text (video, infographic, story format)</li>
                            <li><b>be diverse:</b> in ethnicity, gender, age, social background, etc</li>
                            <li>allow users to review news stories, similar to how people can review books they read</li>
                            <li><b>allow users to find the type of news they want to see:</b> good search engine, algorithm to curate their news feed, filtering options — an option is also to allow users to curate their own feed (like how on Instagram you can block certain words, get recommended more of the same type of content if you like/save/comment more, ask to be recommended less of certain content, stop showing certain ads if they're too repetitive/irrelevant, etc)</li>
                            <li><b>have good ux:</b> easy to navigate, easy to find things, etc</li>
                            <li>allow users to choose what type of news they might want more when they first enter</li>
                            <li>be accessible on mobile (since younger audiences are much more likely to consume news from their phones than any other device)</li>
                            <li>have an indication of general opinion from users/general public</li>
                            <li><b>be verifiable:</b> have sources for all the presented information</li>
                            <li><b>incorporate positivity:</b> recommend optimistic news stories after heavier reports, give users encouraging messages/reminders every now and then, etc</li>
                            <li>be shareable (to other social media sites)</li>
