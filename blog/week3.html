                    <h1>adjustments</h1>
                    <p>I decided a website doesn’t make sense for this project, since the majority of Gen Z get news via their phones. Instead, the solution will take the form of an app which still serves the same purposes as was established previously. This disrupts the structure of the design, however, and so I adjusted the site map to make more sense. I also noticed in the first round of lo-fi prototyping last week that the site map was missing some features; those were also added in here.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>navigation is intuitive, users were able to move around the different pages easily without getting stuck</li>
                            <li>users liked the options for block view + list view since users sometimes want to be able to scroll through headlines quickly, and sometimes want to just mindlessly scroll and mainly look at the images</li>
                            <li>users instinctively swiped up and then tapped outside of pop up to get rid of it, and then noticed the X button</li>
                            <li>feels off to users that the search bar + news categories are floating without a background behind them</li>
                            <li>users liked the app’s purpose being focused on positivity</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Since moving from the midfi prototype to the first hifi prototype, the following things were adjusted:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>footer + header no longer float; they now cover the full width of the screen and start from the very top/bottom of the screen/li>
                            <li>background behind search bar + news categories</li>
                            <li>new loading screen</li>
                            <li>“working” slider (can be interacted with)</li>
                            <li>interactive keyboard popup</li>
                            <li>flows can now loop endlessly (users can log out via flow 3 and start at flow 1 again)</li>
                            <li>positive pop up can be closed by tapping rather than swiping or X button (with text to help user if they get stuck)</li>
                        </ul>
