                    <p>Another round of user testing was done on the first iteration of the hi-fi prototype produced last week. User testers are aged 18, 21 and 25, and all user testers own smartphones.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>all users found navigation easy and intuitive; whenever a user ended up on a page they didn't want to be they were able to find their way back quickly without trouble</li>
                            <li>one user didn't pay any attention to the onboarding panels; sign up/sign in buttons had more weight and took their attention first</li>
                            <li>one user commented that the yellow hyperlinks were difficult to read</li>
                            <li>users liked scroll top top feature on articles</li>
                            <li>users found category selection on home page unintuitive; the intuition was that clicking on a category would take them to a new page with feed from that category only</li>
                            <li>one user suggested 'global' and 'arts/culture' categories to be added</li>
                            <li>one user suggested that articles had a woop meter to indicate the positivity level</li>
                            <li>two users commented that they would've liked a dark mode feature</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>reorder onboarding pages so users have more incentive to interact with that first</li>
                            <li>change category bar to switch page when a category is selected (unless i run out of time)</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>because of the time crunch, a dark mode option won't be implemented for an MVP despite many users wanting that feature (this isn't the first time it's been brought up, but it's never been prioritised)</li>
                            <li>woop meter would be attempted if there is enough time, otherwise it isn’t necessary for MVP</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h1>reflective statement</h1>
                    <p><b>Description</b></p>
                    <p>During the iterative design process, user testing was then done for every iteration of prototyping from mid-fi onwards. I missed a few rounds of user testing in the early stages of lo-fi prototyping.</p>
                    <p><b>Feeling</b></p>
                    <p>I found it a little frustrating that I ended up picking up little problems in user testing later on which could've been resolved earlier if I had done user testing in the lo-fi stages.</p>
                    <p><b>Evaluation</b></p>
                    <p>User testing went well when it was conducted. What didn't work as well in the whole experience was that problems could've been resolved earlier if testing was earlier.</p>
                    <p><b>Analysis</b></p>
                    <p>User testing went well because despite not doing any in the lo-fi stages, the prototypes were still refined in small increments, so the mid-fi prototype didn't differ very much from the previous iterations. This made it easy to made changes quickly. Subsequent user tests were easy to respond to because of this as well.</p>
                    <p>As for what didn't go well, I didn't know the floating search bar and news categories felt off to users until the mid-fi stage. If testing had been done before then, I could have adjusted the prototype by this iteration and tested the new version at that point instead. Things got slightly delayed as a result.</p>
                    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                    <p>I learned that iterative designing is most effective when user testing is done at every single stage, not just when the prototypes "look" and "function" more like an app. Though user testing in early lo-fi stages might be more work for me as the person creating and explaining the interactions, the early feedback can save me effort later on.</p>
                    <p><b>Action</b></p>
                    <p>Next time I will create a user testing plan at the very beginning of the process so I can test immediately upon finishing the first prototype, and for every iteration after that.</p>
