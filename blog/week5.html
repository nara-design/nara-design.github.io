                    <p>I asked a few people about complaints they had living in the city of Christchurch. These were recorded in a bullet-point list then compiled into an affinity diagram.</p>

                    <p>I decided to focus on three particular issues brought up in the empathy interviews: job hunting, public parking and public transport. The information found through research on these topics was then combined with the existing affinity diagram to get a bigger picture of the problems.</p>

                    <h1>problem statement</h1>
                    <p>Through the SWOT analyses, I came to the conclusion that public parking was the most logical and realistic problem to focus on. And so the problem statement was defined:</p>
                    <p><b>Driving in Christchurch is challenging because it is difficult to find parking options in the city.</b></p>
                    <p>This was then reframed as a "how might we" question:</p>
                    <p><b>How might we create a digital solution that helps people find parking options in Christchurch?</b></p>
                    <p>My solution is to create website that allows users to find available parking options for their destinations, as well as view information regarding those options (ie. time limits, fees, peak hours, etc).</p>
