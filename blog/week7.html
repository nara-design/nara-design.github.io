                    <h2>reflective statement</h2>
                    <p><b>Description: What happened?</b></p>
                    <p>I presented the work I'd done on this project so far on 12 slides at 20 seconds each.</p>
                    <p><b>Feeling: How did I feel?</b></p>
                    <p>I wasn't particularly nervous up to or during the presentation, surprisingly. However, I did get a bit flustered right at the beginning.</p>
                    <p><b>Evaluation: What went well, what didn't?</b></p>
                    <p>When my turn came up my mic suddenly stopped working so I had to quickly switch mics. That threw me off a bit, and I fumbled over what to say during the first two slides.</p>
                    <p>However, as soon as those two slides had passed, the rest of the presentation was fine.</p>
                    <p><b>Analysis: Why did/didn't things go well?</b></p>
                    <p>The mic probably stopped working because it's too old and unreliable. Fumbling at the start happened because of that and because I hadn't planned what to say during those two slides. But the rest of the presentation was fine because I'd gotten some practice in the previous week and so had a decent feel for the content/timing.</p>
                    <p><b>Conclusion: What did I learn?</b></p>
                    <p>I learned that I should plan more for presentations.</p>
                    <p><b>Action: What will I do differently next time?</b></p>
                    <p>Next time I will plan what to say for every single slide, not just some of them. I will also probably get a new more reliable mic, and test it thoroughly beforehand.</p>

                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>too much spacing with the nav links; try a button style with more distinction between each link (rule of three)</li>
                            <li>feels off that header colours blend into content colours</li>
                            <li>more breathing room in the densely packed pages</li>
                            <li>try separating sign up/login into separate pages, or experiment with colours to make it feel lighter (it’s too dense)</li>
                            <li>header has too much weight, needs to be smaller</li>
                            <li>log out confirmation background feels visually strange and inconsistent with rest of design</li>
                            <li>mobile header is a bit inconsistent compared to the desktop header</li>
                            <li>text on on both desktop and mobile are easily readable</li>
                            <li>sometimes the mash of more than two colours directly next to each other is jarring</li>
                            <li>after signing up/logging in, the new page being the account page doesn’t feel intuitive (gets confusing as it looks like the next step in the sign up process)</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>adjust header sizing/colours/spacing/etc</li>
                            <li>make header more distinguishable from content—underline or something</li>
                            <li>adjust mobile header to match desktop header</li>
                            <li>separate sign up/login pages</li>
                            <li>change logout confirmation background (solid colour instead)</li>
                            <li>adjust colour proportions</li>
                            <li>replace placeholder images with actual images</li>

                            <li>maybe the logo in the mobile header could be swapped for text that says ParkMaster so it matches with the desktop header more (and the logo could should up in the menu instead)</li>
                            <li>the feature where user can tap on map on mobile to view a larger version (and tap back on the bottom to return to before) works intuitively</li>
                            <li>it’s not very clear that the search results at the bottom of the screen are scrollable</li>
                            <li>hamburger menu + cross button on mobile could be beefed up a bit to match the blockiness of everything else</li>
                            <li>hamburger menu icon is difficult to tap</li>
