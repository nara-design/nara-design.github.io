                    <h1>reflective statement</h1>
                    <p><b>Description: What happened?</b></p>
                    <p>During the prototyping of this project I implemented some features that I wasn't confident about having to code later on (in particular: input forms and a functioning hamburger menu).</p>
                    <p><b>Feeling: How did I feel?</b></p>
                    <p>I felt a bit anxious about learning and applying unfamiliar HTML/CSS and Javascript, but since they were things I'd wanted to learn before, I was also excited to try.</p>
                    <p><b>Evaluation: What went well, what didn't?</b></p>
                    <p>The amount of unfamiliar features I included was pretty good as I didn't feel like I'd run out of time to code them. However, I still think my understanding is lacking.</p>
                    <p><b>Analysis: Why did/didn't things go well?</b></p>
                    <p>I think my understanding is still lacking as I had just a week to code everything up and couldn't commit much time to properly understanding everything I was coding.</p>
                    <p><b>Conclusion: What did I learn?</b></p>
                    <p>I learnt that a week is enough time to code up a basic website, but not enough time to simultaneously learn to code new features.</p>
                    <p><b>Action: What will I do differently next time?</b></p>
                    <p>Next time I will plan for more time to code so I have enough breathing room to understanding anything unfamiliar.</p>
